## Reflection

This was a project designed to help me better understand how ecommerce websites opporate.  
    
My goal was to create an application that I could use someday if I wanted to sell something.  That meant I needed to include a payments system and be mindful of the security issues that may occur when dealing with transactions.  

I used the Stripe API for payment processing and thanks to their amazing documentation as well as some well written articles on ecommerce best practices, I was able to put together a solid foundation for an ecommerce site.  

As I grow as a developer I will continue to update and upgrade this projects as I learn about new things I can improve.
